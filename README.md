# ⚡ Load Shedding Predictor (Pakistan)

Predicting daily electricity load shedding hours in major Pakistani cities using machine learning and weather-based features.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

This project aims to forecast the number of daily electricity outage hours in cities like Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad based on weather and time-related features. It simulates realistic load shedding data and demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand patterns of electricity load shedding using data visualization.
- Predict daily outage hours using ML algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- Build a web interface to allow user-friendly predictions.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for web app)
- Google Colab (Jupyter notebooks)
- GitHub (version control)
