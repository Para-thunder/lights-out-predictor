A machine learning project to predict electricity load shedding hours in Pakistani cities.

# ⚡ Lights Out Predictor

Predicting electricity load shedding hours in Pakistani cities using machine learning.

## 🔍 Project Overview
In Pakistan, unpredictable power outages affect millions. This project uses machine learning to forecast daily load shedding durations based on features like day, temperature, and city.

## 📦 Features
- Predict daily load shedding hours
- City-level insights (e.g., Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad)
- Streamlit app interface
- Daily GitHub updates with progress

## 🧠 ML Models
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## 📊 Dataset
If public data is unavailable, synthetic yet realistic outage datasets will be generated based on real trends and weather conditions.

## 🚀 App Demo
(Coming soon — will be deployed via [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or Hugging Face Spaces)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for frontend)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🗓️ Daily Progress Log
- **June 14**: Initialized repo, planned dataset structure
- **June 15**: Added synthetic data generator + started EDA
- _(Update this daily!)_
